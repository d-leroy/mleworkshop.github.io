## Description

The Modeling Language Engineering and Execution (MLE) workshop
aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners working on modeling language engineering. It is a meeting opportunity for Software Language Engineering (SLE) enthusiasts within the software modeling community.


## Current edition

The [MLE 2020](mle2020) will be co-located with [MODELS 2020](http://www.modelsconference.org), held between Sun 18 - Fri 23 October 2020 in [Montreal, Canada](https://conf.researchr.org/venue/models-2020/models-2020-venue). 

## Past editions

In 2019, MLE was born from the merge of two long standing workshops: the International Workshop on
The Globalization of Modeling Languages (GEMOC) and the International Workshop on Executable Modeling (EXE).
